And I don't know what you're gonna do
Don't know about me
One, two, three, let's go

Tell me when you want me too
So get around me

So run for the gold, run for the money
Run for the infinity
We'll never return and be free
But every time that I come around
There's too many little things they know about us
No, I can't play
